  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Marcos E. Salas-Saavedra, Ph.D., is an environmental geochemist and Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University whose research bridges geochronology, geochemistry, and paleoclimate. He investigates past climate and sea-level variability using coral archives and carbonate systems, with expertise in U–Th geochronology, trace-element geochemistry, and multi-instrument workflows (LA-ICP-MS, MC-ICP-MS, LIBS, micro-CT/3D, SEM). Marcos combines rigorous laboratory methods with Python-based data processing, time-series analysis, and quality assurance for low-level trace element detection, including REEs. His fieldwork spans the Great Barrier Reef and Curaçao, and his publications include contributions to Quaternary Science Reviews, Chemical Geology, and Sedimentary Geology. At Princeton, he leads projects on dating meteoric calcite in altered fossil corals to improve sea-level reconstructions and on coral proxy records for ENSO variability, while mentoring graduate students and helping coordinate laboratory operations. He earned his Ph.D. in Geochemistry and Geochronology from The University of Queensland and earlier degrees from the Austral University of Chile.</p>

    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Marcos E. Salas-Saavedra, Ph.D., is an environmental geochemist whose work integrates geochronology, analytical chemistry, and climate reconstruction to answer questions about how reef systems and sea level have changed through time. He is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University, where he investigates past climate and sea-level variability using coral archives and carbonate materials. His technical expertise spans U–Th geochronology; radiogenic and stable isotope analysis; trace-element and REE geochemistry; and advanced instrumentation including LA-ICP-MS, MC-ICP-MS, LIBS, micro-CT/3D imaging, and SEM.

Marcos develops and applies high-precision methods to challenging carbonate samples, including meteoric calcite phases in highly altered fossil corals, to refine sea-level reconstructions. He also builds Python-based workflows for data reduction, time-series analysis, and rigorous QA/QC at ultra-low detection levels—capabilities he uses to extract seasonal to multi-decadal signals (e.g., ENSO) from coral proxy records. His portfolio includes instrument optimization, automated column chemistry (prepFAST MC), and gravimetric spike preparation that improves dating accuracy.

He has conducted field campaigns on the Great Barrier Reef and in the southern Caribbean (Curaçao), collecting materials for geochronology, carbonate chemistry, and stable isotope studies of reef metabolism. Marcos’ publications include work in Quaternary Science Reviews, Chemical Geology, and Sedimentary Geology, and he has presented at major meetings such as AGU. In the lab, he mentors graduate students in advanced analytical techniques and contributes to safe, efficient laboratory operations and instrument maintenance planning.

Collectively, his work aims to deliver robust, decision-relevant insights into Earth system change by pairing meticulous laboratory practice with transparent, reproducible computation—and by communicating those results to both scientific and broader communities.</p>
